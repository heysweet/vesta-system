In the wake of calamity, divisions between the [[Humes]] and the [[Beastkin]] are pushed to their limit as the Hume attempt to colonize beyond their broken planet.

[[Locations/The Vesta System/Vesta/index|Vesta]], once the heart of a thriving star system, still bears the scars of [[Cataclysm]] which shattered nations and poisoned skies. A century later, the land is healing, but it is no longer gentle. As breathable air returns and technology offers salvation beneath gleaming domes, power is once again up for grabs. The [[Kingdom of Stylmor]] reaches for land in the planets beyond, at the cost of the [[Beastkin Tribes]] already living there. In a [[Vesta System]] campaign, you’ll play ordinary people caught in extraordinary times. Will you find the courage to stand up against tyranny, or watch as worlds fall to greed and ambition?
