## Backstory

The Cataclysm struck during one of the long eras of peace that made [[Locations/The Vesta System/Vesta/index|Vesta]] a comfortable home for millions. Just over a century ago, an asteroid—believed to be a natural phenomenon—collided with Vesta, reshaping the world in a single, devastating moment. Earthquakes, heat waves, and tsunamis ravaged the surface, while vaporized rock filled the atmosphere, forming a dark cloud that lingered for decades. The sky dimmed to a perpetual twilight, and the stars vanished from view.
