The two suns of the [[index|Vesta System]] are Osiris and Attis. With a binary star system, two shadows are cast most of the time. There are regular periods of [[Sunclipses]].

## Osiris, The Great Father

*Life and Death*

The larger of the [[Two Suns]], Osiris casts a pale golden light. He is seen as a fatherly figure, with domain over the forces of life and death themselves.

While Osiris eclipses Attis, they say good fortune and bad fortune are more likely. The DM will critically succeed on 19 and 20, and critically fail on 1 and 2.

## Attis, The All-Mother

*Fortitude and Fragility*

The lesser and bluer of the [[Two Suns]]. Attis represents Fortitude and Fragility as she stands up to and survives her "fights" with Osiris even though she is weaker. She is a constant reminder that struggle is what keeps us going.

When Attis eclipses Osiris, people say that difficult people, relationships, and strugglers will be more extreme. PC rolls with Hope are consider to have a +1 and rolls with Fear are considered to have a -1.
