## Details

Fourth planet from the [[Two Suns]]. A moderate climate and vibrantly diverse ecology allow for all manner of creatures and races to call this planet home.

Before the [[Cataclysm]], the planet Vesta was the crown jewel of the eponymous binary star system. Of the seven planets in its orbit, Vesta possessed the most moderate climate and supported a diverse ecology, earning it the nickname "The Hearth". Its population was a vibrant melting pot of both [[Humes]] and their cousins, the [[Beastkin]]. Though far from perfect, long eras of peace and prosperity made Vesta a comfortable home for millions.

Over the ensuing century, the planet has begun a slow recovery. Skies clear, masks are no longer needed to breathe outside, and settlements are once again returning to the surface. Even so, once-great nations have been reduced to fractured colonies or erased entirely. Vesta bears permanent scars, its former splendor irretrievably lost.

During the long twilight, [[Shadows]]—twisted, alien creatures that have always posed a danger to travelers—spread across the land.
