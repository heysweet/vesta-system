| Survival needs        | Straying away from the Twilight Ring for longer than a few minutes can result in severe consequences. The Day side of the planet reaches higher temperatures than [[Ur]], while the Night side is sub-zero. Any exploration outside the Twilight Ring requires careful planneting and various types of weather gear. |

The sixth planet from the [[Two Suns]]. Since it's tidally-locked with the suns, there is no day-night cycle. Ancient ruins scatter the Twilight Ring, however it's very far from the suns and is very difficult to survive. Most of the remains of the [[Infernis]]' civilization can be found on Y'shika.
