While **Osiris** is eclipsed, PC rolls with Hope are consider to have a +1 and rolls with Fear are considered to have a -1.

While **Attis** is eclipsed, the DM will critically succeed on 19 and 20, and critically fail on 1 and 2.

Due to the [[Two Suns]] of the [[Vesta System]], two shadows are cast most of the time. There are regular periods of Sunclipses, where one sun passes in front of the other as they orbit. During this period, it would appear as if there were only one sun, thus casting only one shadow as well. This would mean for a few hours every week, [[Vesta]] would experience less solar light and radiation that typical. Suns-set could happen simultaneously if paired with an eclipsed, or could be hours apart if the starts are far away from each other.

Sunclipses occur regularly enough that they are not regarded as particularly terrifying or awe-inspiring, though there are superstitious beliefs about the time during a Sunclipse, since it feels odd to exist in a world with only one sun. When Osiris is eclipsed, people say that difficult people, relationships, and strugglers will be more extreme. While when Attis is eclipsed, they say good fortune and bad fortune are more likely.

Sunclipses are auspicious times which raise the stakes. They can be used at the DMs discretion but should not be overused. They occur roughly once per week on [[Vesta]], but can be missed if they coincide with nightfall. Other planets may have different frequencies and durations of Sunclipses, depending on their distance from the suns. For instance, [[Ur]] being closer to the suns means it sees nearly double the number of Sunclipses as Vesta, but they are also more brief.
