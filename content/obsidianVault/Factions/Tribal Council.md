The [[Beastkin]] Tribal Council is one of the [[Vesta System]]'s governing bodies. In recent years, the Tribal Council has voiced growing alarm over [[Prince Giltrek]]'s intentions to expand beyond [[Vesta]]. The [[Sister Planets]] have always been Beastkin homelands, and while they acknowledge the [[Humes]]' suffering, they are unwilling to surrender their own.
