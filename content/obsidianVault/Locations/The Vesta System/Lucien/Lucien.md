| Survival needs | Temperatures on the surface hover between zero and twenty degrees, so warm clothing is essential for survivability. Most food on the planet is inedible for [[Humes]], so rations must be prepared ahead of time. Visibility is low even during the daytime, with peak brightness being akin to [[Vesta]]'s twilight hours. |
A cold and desolate place, furthest from the [[Two Suns]]. Its atmosphere is quite thin, making stars visible at all times of day. There are fields of pure obsidian across its surface. There's very little soil and crops don't do well on the surface, but small creatures like goblins have explored the array of tunnels throughout the planet and are able to survive by raising "cattle" — worm like burrowing creatures who themselves eat mostly rock.
