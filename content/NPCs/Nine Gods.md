Objects in the planetary system of Vesta are regarded as Gods, and it is believed that magic in the realms flows from their divine force. Each god, like the binary nature of the star system itself, contains its own antithesis. As unfathomable as these great powers are, they can give or take depending on their mood.

## Osiris, The Great Father

*Life and Death*

The larger of the [[Two Suns]], Osiris casts a pale golden light. He is seen as a fatherly figure, with domain over the forces of life and death themselves.

## Attis, The All-Mother

*Fortitude and Fragility*

The lesser and bluer of the [[Two Suns]]. Attis represents Fortitude and Fragility as she stands up to and survives her "fights" with Osiris even though she is weaker. She is a constant reminder that struggle is what keeps us going.

## [[Ur]], The Warrior

*Power and Ineptitude*

The powerful Knight Ur is the warrior's god. They ar esought after in prayer for victory in battle, as well as by those who are not strong by nature so as to find their strength within.

## [[Oceanys]], The Sage

*Knowledge and Ignorance*

Wizards, Engineers, and those who keep to their books find Oceanys to be their favored deity. People will also pray to them if they or a friend happen to be acting foolishly or without regard for consequences.

## [[Terra]], The Empress

*Vitality and Disease*

Those in the medical field often wear symbols of Terra on their uniform.

## [[Locations/The Vesta System/Vesta/index|Vesta]], The Hearth

*Wisdom and Folly*

Regarded as highly as Osiris and Attis in many [Hume](Factions/Humes.md) circles.

## [[Har]], The Emperor

*Freedom and Chains*

The most divisive deity, as their supporters are split down the middle between those who would claim freedom the highest call and those who would say chains create structure and order.*

## [[Y'shika]], The Virgin

*Innocence and Guilt*

As the embodiment of all things sinful and sinless, they are feared as much as they are beloved. Many accused of crimes they did not commit will appeal to them for mercy.

## [[Lucien]], The Hermit

*Secrets and Transparency*

Those who trade in information regard this god highly. Most others do not.
