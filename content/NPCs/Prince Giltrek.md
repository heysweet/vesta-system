## Backstory

Prince Giltrek leads the [[Kingdom of Stylmor]]. His grandfather, [[Dendrilon]], raise the first [[Terradome]] over seventy-five years ago.

Ambitious yet broadly respected, Giltrek has invested heavily in technological advancement, with his stated goal being to “improve the lives of all Vestians”. Lately, he’s been pouring money and support into the [[Technogeeks]]—the city’s guild of scientists and engineers—aiming to create more Terradomes and beginning development the first Interplanetary Airships (thus far a failed project).

Most recently, the Technogeeks uncovered a strange new substance mined from the asteroid’s impact crater. Known as [[Dark Matter]], its properties are poorly understood, but its potential has already drawn intense interest—and quiet concern.
