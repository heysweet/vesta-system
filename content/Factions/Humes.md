The Humes, unsuited to a life beyond Vesta, had nowhere to go. They retreated underground to escape poisoned air and widespread devastation, carving out small communities in caves, bunkers, and other shelters. In the years that followed, resentment and guilt for the [[Beastkin]] who left them behind took root among the Humes.
