Long before the [[Cataclysm]], the lineage of Infernis are believed to have constructed the [[Interplanetary Portals]] that link [[Locations/The Vesta System/Vesta/index|Vesta]] to the [[Sister Planets]]. What remains of their civilization—most prominently on [[Y'shika]]—is marked by massive horned motifs carved into stone and metal, silent monuments to a powerful and purpose now lost.
