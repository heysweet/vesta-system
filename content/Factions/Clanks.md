Clanks from the [[Oceanys]] tend to be made of Stone, while [[Humes|Hume]] Clanks tend to be made of metal. Some Clanks are remnants of an ancient civilization which died out long before the [[Cataclysm]]. They left behind advanced tech that is still being unearthed, but is not widely understood. Clanks from this era are extremely rare and easily recognized by their elaborate horns.
