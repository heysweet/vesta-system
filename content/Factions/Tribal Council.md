The [[Beastkin]] Tribal Council is one of the [[index|Vesta System]]'s governing bodies. In recent years, the Tribal Council has voiced growing alarm over [[Prince Giltrek]]'s intentions to expand beyond [[Locations/The Vesta System/Vesta/index|Vesta]]. The [[Sister Planets]] have always been Beastkin homelands, and while they acknowledge the [[Humes]]' suffering, they are unwilling to surrender their own.
