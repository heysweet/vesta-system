The Technogeeks are the guild of crafters, engineers, and learned folk in the capital city of [[Solaris]] whose aim is to build technology that enhance survivability and quality of life of the those in the [[Kingdom of Stylmor]], and [[Locations/The Vesta System/Vesta/index|index]] as a whole. They developed a much of the modern tech that enables [[Humes]] to more easily survive on the [[Sister Planets|other planets]].

Lately, [[Prince Giltrek]] has been pouring money and support into the Technogeeks, aiming to create more [[Terradome|Terradomes]] and beginning development the first Interplanetary Airships (thus far a failed project).

Most recently, the Technogeeks uncovered a strange new substance mined from the [[Cataclysm|asteroid]]’s impact crater. Known as [[Dark Matter]], its properties are poorly understood, but its potential has already drawn intense interest—and quiet concern.
