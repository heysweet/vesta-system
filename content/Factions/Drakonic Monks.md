Enigmatic to those outside, these Drakona do not seem to interfere much with either the [[Beastkin Tribes]] or the [[Humes]]' worlds. Instead they seem to have an "above it all" attitude that comes with their long lifespans. They've seen the worlds change and die many times and have little interest in meddling.
