In the fallout of the [[Cataclysm]] that befell [[Locations/The Vesta System/Vesta/index|Vesta]], while the [[Humes]] were unsuited to life beyond Vesta, the Beastkin were already well-suited to the harsher climates of other planets in the [[index|Vesta System]]. They fled Vesta through the [[Interplanetary Portals]] to survive. In doing so, they abandoned ancestral lands and homes, a choice that saved lives but left lasting scars.

They collectively have formed the [[Beastkin Tribes]] of the Vesta system, one of the three governing bodies alongside the [[Kingdom of Stylmor]] and the [[Drakona]].
