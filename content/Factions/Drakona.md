Alongside the [[Kingdom of Stylmor]] and the [[Beastkin Tribes]], a third power watches from the margins. The Drakona maintain laboratories and libraries across the planets of the [[Locations/The Vesta System/index|Vesta System]]. They rarely interfere in broader politics, a restraint that has earned them wary tolerance from the Beastkin Tribes. Their [[Drakonic Archives]], guarded closely and shared sparingly, are objects of fascination throughout the system, their true scope known only to their keepers.
